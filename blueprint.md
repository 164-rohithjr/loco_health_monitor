# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern and visually appealing "Loco Health Monitor" application. The application will provide real-time tracking and diagnostics for the Indian Railways fleet, enabling proactive maintenance and performance optimization.

## Current State

The project is a React application set up with Vite and Tailwind CSS. The initial file structure is in place, but the components need to be built out to match the target design.

## Plan

The application will be built using a component-based architecture. The following components will be created or updated:

*   **`Navbar`**: A navigation bar with the application logo and links to the "Home" and "Tracking" pages.
*   **`HomePage`**: The main landing page of the application, which will be composed of the following sections:
    *   **Hero Section**: A prominent section with a compelling headline and call-to-action buttons.
    *   **Features Section**: A section highlighting the key features of the application.
    *   **Stats Section**: A section displaying key statistics about the application's impact.
    *   **Footer**: A footer with copyright information and links.
*   **`TrackingPage`**: A page to display real-time tracking information for the locomotives. (This will be implemented in a future iteration).
*   **`App`**: The main application component that will handle routing.

## Styling

The application will be styled using Tailwind CSS. The design will be modern, clean, and visually appealing, with a consistent color scheme and typography. The primary color will be a shade of purple, as shown in the design mockups.

## Design and Features

### Aesthetics and User Experience

*   **Modern Design**: The UI will be clean, with a balanced layout and ample whitespace.
*   **Color Palette**: A vibrant color palette will be used, with purple as the accent color.
*   **Typography**: Expressive and legible fonts will be used to create a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Iconography**: Icons will be used to enhance usability and visual appeal.
*   **Interactivity**: Interactive elements will have clear visual feedback.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Data Streaming and Analysis**
*   **Predictive Maintenance Alerts**
*   **Comprehensive Performance Dashboards**
*   **Real-time Locomotive Tracking**

### Accessibility

The application will be designed with accessibility in mind, following a11y standards to ensure it is usable by a wide range of users.
